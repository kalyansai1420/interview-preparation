# OOPS

- why do we need OOPS ?
  - It helps to structure software around objects that represent real-world entitites or abstract concepts.
  - this modeling aligns with how people naturally think about and describe systems, make code understandable, resuable and maintable
  - Key Pillars of OOPs
    - Encapsulation
      - bundling data and methods into a single unit or class
      - why ? 
        - it reduces complexity by hiding internal details
        - external code interacts though welldefined interfaces only
    - Inheritance
      - mechanism where one class inherits properties and behaviours from another 
      - promotoes code resuability and can simplify the hierarchy of classes
    - Polymorphism
      - ability to present the same interface but have different underlying forms or implementations
      - makes code more flexible by allowing objects of different classes to be used interchangeably if they share the same interface
    - Abstraction
      - hiding complex implementation details and exposing only functionalities
      - simplifies interactions, allows you to focus on "what" an object does rather than "how" it does it
