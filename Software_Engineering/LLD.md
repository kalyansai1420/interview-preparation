## Chess Game

- Clarify Requirements
  - main focus is modeling the board, pieces and move rules
  - basic 2-player scenario
  - need to handle or detect check/checkmate, basic moves and special moves
- Identifying Core Entities
  - ChessGame
    - central orchestrator
    - manage the current turn, track moves or determine game-over conditions
  - Board
    - 8*8 grid
    - contains cells that either hold a piece or empty
  - Cell
    - has coordinates (row,colum or rank)
    - hold a reference to a Piece
  - Piece (abstract class or interface)
    - Common methods/flieds for all chess pieces: color (black,white), possibly the piece's current position
    - Abstract method like canMove(Board board, Cell start, Cell end) to validate moves.
  - Concrete Piece Classes
    - Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King
    - Eahc overrides canMove() with its own rules.
  - Player
    - Holds info about color, plus logic tomake a mve (human input or AI if needed)
  - Move
    - structure or class that records a move''s detail(start cell, end cell, captured piece, etc)
    - helps with undo/redo or replay moves if needed
  - GameState
    - ongoing white won, black won, draw etc
- Model Interactions
- Handling Special Moves
- Checking Check/Checkmate
- Potential Design Patterns
  - Factory Pattern for piece creation
    - if you a piece type as enum (PAWN, ROOK, etc) a factory can provide the proper subclass instance
  - Strategy Pattern for movement logic
    - Each piece is like a movement strategy
  - Observer Pattern
    - If we have a UI that upfates whene the board chnages
