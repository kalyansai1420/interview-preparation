# LiteMQ

- a simple message broker
- implement a log-bassed message queue with disk persistence
- Use java nio for efficient network communication
- support producer-consumer patterns with message acknowledgements
- optimize high throughputs using batching and compression

- core features
  - prodcuers and consumers : Clients can send and receive messages
  - persistent storage (log based) : messages are stored on disk for durability
  - message acknowledgement : Consumers must acknowledge message receipt
  - fifo ordering : message should be delivered in the order they were produced
  - concurrency & multi-threading : multiple producers/consumers should work efficiently
- architecture overview
  - producer send messages to the log writer
  - log writer appends messgaes to segmented logs(fixed-size files)
  - an indexing system maps message offsets to log file locations for fast retrival
  - consumers read messages from segmented logs using indexing for efficent lookup
  - the consumer offset tracker maintain the last read position for each consumer
- Implemented logwriter
  - designed logwriter to write messages to log files in an append only format
  - implemented log rotation when file size exceeds the limit
  - used bufferedwriter for efficient disk I/O
  - allowed confirgurable log directory and file size limits
- Implemented logreader
  - designed logreader to read messages in fifo order
  - handled EOF correctly
  - implemented bufferedreader for efficient reading
- advanced features
  - Offset Tracking
    - Essential for consumer recovery, improves reliability
  - Pub/Sub Model
    - Expands beyond FIFO queues, supports event driven models
  - Replication & Fault Tolerance
    - Ensures data durabilit and availability in case of failures
  - Batching & Compression
    - Improves throughput and storage efficieny
  - Prority Quques
    - Enables time-sensitive message processing
  - Dead letter queue
    - useful for handling fialed messgaes
